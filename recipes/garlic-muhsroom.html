            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>2 pounds sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1 cup red wine</li>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>

            <ol>

                <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms are a light golden brown and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low, and pour wine into the skillet. Simmer until wine has mostly evaporated. Serve immediately.</li>
